        <h2 class="border">Background</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>I’m an aspiring Cybersecurity professional who loves everything about the web and learning. I have lived in a few different places (but mainly firehouses) and have worked varying jobs prior to my joining the fire department.</li><li> I’m excited to bring my life experience to the process of keeping people and businesses secure.</li>
          <li>In a past life, I was both a Paid and Volunteer Firefighter in very busy Departments both in and surrounding our Nations Capitol for quite a long time. A back injury forced me into retirement. Now, I hope to pursue Cybersecurity and Software Development through Champlain College online.</li>
           <li>I am currently studying these fields with hopes to obtain a career in either the private or government sectors in this ever growing field.</li>
         </ul>
